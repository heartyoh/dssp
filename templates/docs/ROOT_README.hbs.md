ThingsFactory&trade; is a software framework brand for the production of commercial-level web applications licensed by [Hatiolab](https://www.hatiolab.com).

ThingsFactory&trade; Micro-Module Edition implements an architecture that produces web applications by composing fine-grained micro modules.

These modules compose together to help you create performant modern JS apps that you love to develop and test. These packages are developed primarily to be used on top of the stack we like best for our JS apps; Typescript for the flavor, Koa for the server, LitElement for UI, Apollo for data fetching, and Jest for tests. That said, you can mix and match as you like.
